      <h1> Most commonly asked questions </h1>
      <hr>

      <h2> Question: Should I apply to a job where I might not have all the qualifications?</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes! Even if you don't have all the requirements, you can still
        have a chance get the job and learn on site. If you are willing to put
        in the work to learn the new skill, go for it.
      </p>
<hr>
      <h2>Question: How long should my cover letter be? </h2>
      <p>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> Your cover letter should be limited to one page, you should
        be able to persuade the reader enough with you skills and history.
      </p>
<hr>
      <h2> Question: I'm applying for a job and it's asking for my SSN, do I trust it?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Do some research on the company and see if the listing is legit.
        If you are filling it out at a public place, make sure your connection is
        safe. Check your URL for the https:// and secure icon at the begining of
        the sites URL to make sure that website is secured. If its not, I
        recommend that you go to the job company and as for an appicaiton there.
      </p>

      <h2> Question: I had an interview and haven't got a call back yet, what do I do???</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> If you haven't got called back in 2-3 days, sometimes its
        just the company not having time to review yet but always follow up with
        them when you can.
      </p>
<hr>
      <h2> Question: I'm looking for an intern, what's the process?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The process for finding an internship is well the same as
        finding a job. Many job searching sites include internships as an option.
