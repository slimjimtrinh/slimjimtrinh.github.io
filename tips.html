      <h1> Top ten tips</h1>
  </div>

   <div>
     <ol>
       <li> Don't stress - The biggest problem people have is being over stressed
         and worried try to relax as you will make less mistakes that way.</li>

       <li> Revise your work - The most common mistake is making those small
         typos that employers will notice always double check your work.
         Even if you have to ask another friend or family member to do so. </li>

       <li> Research interview questions in advance and practice answering them.
          You will be so much more prepared to answer them when asked.</li>

       <li> Be on time - It is much better to arrive early than to show up
         late. Showing up early will allow you to appear more committed to have that job, and
         it also allows you to prepare in the meantime.</li>

       <li> Turn your phone off or make it silent - if your phone goes off
         during the interview, your chances of getting that job are slim to none.</li>

       <li> Aways ask questions - be prepared to have some questions ready
         so that you aren't there thoughtless.</li>

       <li> Research the company - Know what they do don't walk in clueless.</li>

       <li> Don't get carried away and talk about your personal life, stay on topic!
       Avoid talking about how bad your last job went or why you got fired.</li>

       <li> Have extra copies of your resume and cover letter with you.</li>

       <li> Follow up - If you do not get a call back from the company you had
         an interview with, give them a call or write an email to them asking about it. </li>
     </ol>
