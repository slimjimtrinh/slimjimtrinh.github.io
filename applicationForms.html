      <h1> Filling out an application </h1>
      <hr>
      <p> Having to fill out multiple job applications may seem very overwhelming
        but once you've finished one, you'll notice that all the rest are
        practically the same. Applications can vary from each company and the
        requirements also differ. whether you are filling it out on paper or on
        an electronic application, the process is very similar.
<br>
<br>
        Be Prepared, have all the materials needed to fill out your application.
<br>
<br>
        Apply with with full honesty some people think that it is okay to
        lie on your application so that you can get the job, but you can get
        into big trouble. If the employer asks you about the thing you lied
        about, and you can't prove or verify it, you will not be considered
        for the job. With honesty, make sure the dates and titles you write
        are up to date.
<br>
<br>
        Other application questions might be your criminal history / felonies.
        You must answer this truthfully as the company is able to get a
        background check on you. Don't lie if you do any drugs either
        drug test are becoming more common.
<br>
<br>
        Employers uses job applications as a way to test you on how you follow
        instructions. Make sure you are filling it out completely, accurately,
        and neatly. If the employer can't read your handwriting, you might as
        well not be called back for that interview.
<br>
<br>
        Always, always go back and
        double check what you have filled out and make sure there are no mistakes.
