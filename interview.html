      <h1> Preparing for an Interview </h1>
      <hr>
      <p> You are usually called in for an interview when an employer
        see's potential in you after looking at your resume. Now is
        your time shine and prove them that you are the one made for the job.
        First impressions are super important, it takes about 7 seconds
        for them to first judge you on your appearance, attitude, and
        professionalism.
      </p>
   </div>

   <div>
     <h1>Appearance</h1>
     <img src="img/interview.jpg" alt="professional clothing">
     <p id="rightp"> Appearance is important because thats probably what the
       employer first see's. You need to be dressed appropriately for
       the job you are applying for. Don't over dress if your job position
       does not require it on a basis. If your job was for a foods
       place, you would want to appear more tidy and clean. Always make
       sure you don't have have strong stench of body odor but also not
       over coloned or perfumed.</p>
   </div>

   <div>
     <h1>Body Language</h1>
     <img src="img/bodylanguage.jpg" alt="professional clothing">
     <p id="leftp"> You body language tells a lot about you. As you meet the
       employer, you want to show up with a smile and greeting the employer
       with a polite greeting and firm handshake.
       As you talk to them, make sure you
       seem attentive as they take and be a good listener by looking interested.
      Your posture as you sit makes a difference too, make you you are sitting
      straight but yet relaxed to not look stiff. Avoid shaking or bouncing
      your leg as you sit and figiting with your hand. If you have trouble
      staying still, try holding a pen in your hand but don't make it a distraction.</p>
   </div>

   <div>
     <h1>Materials you should bring</h1>
     <img src="img/notetaking.jpg" alt-"professional clothing">
     <p id="rightp"> If you appear with a notebook and pen, it make you seem more
      interested as you are able to take notes.
      Take notes on what is important to you but do not just write
      everything down word for word.
