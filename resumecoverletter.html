      <p> There is a difference between a resume and cover letter, many jobs are now
          requireing both and it is important that you have one. Resume gives the
          employer a little taste of you while the cover letter is more of a
          reason why you are qualified for the job you apply for.

     <h1> Resume </h1>

     <img id="rcpic" src="img/resume.PNG" alt="resume">
     <p id="rc">A resume is very important when looking for a job. Your resume is
       basically a outline of your and your job history that you want the
       employer to know. Think of this as if you were trying to sell the
       employers about yourself, you'd want to include things that make you
       stand out of all the other applicants. Many people just turn to use
       the free templates out there but it's a much better outcome if you
       write it on your own.
<br>
<br>
       First step in creating your own resume is your name and contact
       information. Don't be afraid to make you name bigger and bold as
       you want to make yourself stand out. Include you name, address,
       phone number and a professional email address.
<br>
<br>
       The next step is to write a short introdution about the things
       you do or want to do. Think of this as an objective you want the
       employer to know. Make it sound professional and not very personal.
<br>
<br>
      This is where all the fun start, in the rest of your resume,
      you can list things that will make you look or seem successful.
      You can have categories that fits your profile, some example
      of these are education, work history, extracurricular
      experiences, skills, volunteers, interns, awards & honors,
      hobbies & interests, etc. Choose these according to your needs.
      You may find that some of these categories are easier for you to
      fill in and others may just seem blank. Your work history is
      important to your resume, it shows the skills that you have
      got or learned from your last job according to your position.
      Many ask? "How do I fit all of my work history on there,
      I need more than a page". The short answer to that is, you
      don't. You should list the jobs that is the most meaningful
      and what you did best. Don't include thsoe summer jobs you
      took on to get some extra cash. As it may seem good to your,
      employers see that as you not being commited to work.

   <div class="coverletterbox">
     <h1> Cover Letter </h1>
     <hr>
     <img id="rcpic" src="img/coverletter.PNG">
     <p id="rc"> Cover letter is not required for some employers but
       it is becoming more and more popular. Cover letter are more
       dirrectly personal to the company or posittion you are applying
       for. For instant, if you applies to a foods place, you'd want to
       talk about your skills in foods and how you are and will use it at
       the job.
<br>
<br>
      Think of this as a way to brag about yourself and skills but don't
      get carried away with point you are trying to make. Be more specific
      with your skills from your resume but do not say the same things.
<br>
<br>
      Writing your cover letter has about 6 parts depending on how much
      information you got to write about. (If look at the example on the left,
       you'll see that averything is aligned to the left, this is perfered
       because it makes it look a lot more simple and clean.)
<br>
<br>
      1. Start with the date you are writing your cover letter and make sure
          you update it when you use it another time.
<br>
<br>
      2. Add in your contact information. (should match the one in resume)
<br>
<br>
      3. Salutation - who is this letter to?
          Write it to the hiring managers if know the name.
          If not, write it as "To Whome It May Concern".
<br>
<br>
      4. Body - This is where you would write your skills that relates
          to the job and explain why you would be the best canidate for that job.
<br>
<br>
      5. Closing statement - State here that you would love to be able
          to have the chance for an interview and thank the employer
          for their consideration.
<br>
<br>
      6. Signature - Always end your cover letter with a signature
          as proof that all information stated above is correct and true
          to you best understanding.
