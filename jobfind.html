          find a job. The best ones are ones that allow you to customize
          accordingly to your perferences. Know what you are looking for
          when searching for a job first, that will make your search a
          lot more easier. Things such as wage, salary, and type
          of position can help you narrow it down quick. Find a job where
          you would enjoy to work, you're better off working for some
          place you like then comming to work everyday and hating it.
          <br>
          <br>
          The sites listed below are great ways to find job listings but sometimes the
          best way is to go down to your desired work place and ask to apply there.
          You will be able to have a good first impression and be able to show that
          you really want and is the right person for that job.
          You will find that many different sites have the same listings, this is
          because employers try to reach people in as many places as possible, but believe
          it or not, they might not be posting on your favorite site. This is why it is
          best to search in a few different places. If you know which
          company you are intested in, try looking at their own website and search for
          their career opportunities.
          Find websites that are more closely related to your area and community.
