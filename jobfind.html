      <h1> Where is the best place to find a job? </h1>
      <hr>
      <p> There are literally thousands of websites that allow you to find a job.
          The best ones are ones that allow you to customize accordingly to your perferences.
          Know what you are looking for when searching for a job.
          Things such as wage, salary, and type of position can help you narrow it down quick.
          You're better off working for some place you like and enjoy then comming to work everyday and hating it.
          <br>
          <br>
          The sites listed below are great ways to find job listings but sometimes the
          best way to go down to your desired work place and ask to apply there.
          You will find that many different sites have the same listings, this is
          because employers try to reach people in many places as possible but believe
          it or not, they might not be posting on your favorite site.
          Find websites that are more closely related to your area and community.
